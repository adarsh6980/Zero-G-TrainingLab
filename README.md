A zero-gravity interactive training/puzzle scenario where users manipulate objects in weightlessness using hand tracking. This directly mirrors what Mersus does—VR training simulations.

Project Scope:

Scene: Futuristic space station interior

Mechanics:

Hand-tracked object manipulation (grab, throw, rotate)

Objects float with realistic physics in zero-gravity

Simple training task: "Assemble a component while in zero-G"

Performance optimization for hand tracking

Skills Demonstrated:

✅ Unity + C#

✅ Hand tracking integration (XR Hands package + Meta SDK)

✅ Physics system (Rigidbody with custom gravity)

✅ Blender 3D models (futuristic objects, UI elements)

✅ VR optimization techniques

✅ Clean architecture & GitHub documentation
